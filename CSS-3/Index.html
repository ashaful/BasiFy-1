<div id="bmodel"> Before a dream is realized,
     the Soul of the World tests everything that was learned along the way.
    It does this not because it is evil, but so that we can, in addition to realizing our dreams,
    master the lessons we’ve learned as we’ve moved toward that dream. 
    That’s the point at which most people give up. It’s the point at which, 
    as we say in the language of the desert, 
    one 'dies of thirst just when the palm trees have appeared on the horizon.
